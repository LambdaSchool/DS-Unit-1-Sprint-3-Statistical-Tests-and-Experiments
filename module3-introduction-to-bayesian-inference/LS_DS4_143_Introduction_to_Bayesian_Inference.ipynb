And furthermore, the rate of drunk driving (and thus our prior belief)  is 1/1000.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is the likelihood somebody really is drunk if they test positive? Some may guess it's 92% - the difference between the true positives and the false positives. But we have a prior belief of the background/true rate of drunk driving. Sounds like a job for Bayes' theorem!\n",

This is why, in practice, it's important to have a repeated test to confirm (the probability of two false positives in a row is $0.08 * 0.08 = 0.0064$, much lower), and Bayes' theorem has been relevant in court cases where proper consideration of evidence was important."
