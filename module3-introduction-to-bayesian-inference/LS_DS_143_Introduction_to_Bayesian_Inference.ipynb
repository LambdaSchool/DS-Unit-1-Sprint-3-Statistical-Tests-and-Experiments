        "\n",
        "The law of total probability takes this further, considering two variables ($A$ and $B$) and relating their marginal probabilities (their likelihoods considered independently, without reference to one another) and their conditional probabilities (their likelihoods considered jointly). A marginal probability is simply notated as e.g. $P(A)$, while a conditional probability is notated $P(A|B)$, which reads \"probability of $A$ *given* $B$\".\n",

        "\n",
        "This may not seem like an improvement at first, but try to relate it back to the above picture - if you think of sets as physical objects, we're saying that the total probability of $A$ given $B$ is all the little pieces of it intersected with $B$, added together. The conditional probability is then just that again, but divided by the probability of $B$ itself happening in the first place.\n",

        "Why is this important? Scroll back up to the XKCD example - the Bayesian statistician draws a less absurd conclusion because their prior belief in the likelihood that the sun will go nova is extremely low. So, even when updated based on evidence from a detector that is $35/36 = 0.972$ accurate, the prior belief doesn't shift enough to change their overall opinion.\n",
        "\n",
        "There's many examples of Bayes' theorem - one less absurd example is to apply to [breathalyzer tests](https://www.bayestheorem.net/breathalyzer-example/). You may think that a breathalyzer test that is 100% accurate for true positives (detecting somebody who is drunk) is pretty good, but what if it also has 8% false positives (indicating somebody is drunk when they're not)? And furthermore, the rate of drunk driving (and thus our prior belief)  is 1/1000.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is the likelihood somebody really is drunk if they test positive? Some may guess it's 92% - the difference between the true positives and the false positives. But we have a prior belief of the background/true rate of drunk driving. Sounds like a job for Bayes' theorem!\n",

This is why, in practice, it's important to have a repeated test to confirm (the probability of two false positives in a row is $0.08 * 0.08 = 0.0064$, much lower), and Bayes' theorem has been relevant in court cases where proper consideration of evidence was important."
