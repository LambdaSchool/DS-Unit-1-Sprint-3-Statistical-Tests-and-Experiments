And furthermore, the rate of drunk driving (and thus our prior belief)  is 1/1000.\n",

        "What is the likelihood somebody really is drunk if they test positive? Some may guess it's 92% - the difference between the true positives and the false positives. But we have a prior belief of the background/true rate of drunk driving. Sounds like a job for Bayes' theorem!\n",
