The data consists of 435 instances (one for each congressperson), a class (democrat or republican), and 16 binary attributes (yes or no for voting for or against certain issues). Be aware - there are missing values!\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Load and clean the data (or determine the best method to drop observations when running tests)\n",

        "3. Using hypothesis testing, find an issue that republicans support more than democrats with p < 0.01\n",
        "4. Using hypothesis testing, find an issue where the difference between republicans and democrats has p > 0.1 (i.e. there may not be much of a difference)\n",

        "3. You try and create some kind of a visualization that communicates the results of your hypothesis tests. This can be as simple as a histogram of the p-values or the t-statistics."
