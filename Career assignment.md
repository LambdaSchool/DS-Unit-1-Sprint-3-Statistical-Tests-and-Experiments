I got INFJ on the quiz.

1. I think it's a [psuedo scientific test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR9myaHmcEo) approaching the rigor of a horoscope.
I also think it's generally a bad idea to pigeonhole people's personalities. In short, I don't give the results 
any weight. I tend to do fine working in teams or on my own and just try to be respectful, empathetic and listen 
more than I speak.

2. Just shared an alternative way to do something. It seemed to be appreciated. I appreciate it when people take 
the time to give me feedback.
